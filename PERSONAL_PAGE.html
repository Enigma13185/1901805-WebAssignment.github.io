<p style="font-size:110%;"> The above image shows my personality test results. From the <i> MOTIV</i> column it is extremely accurate. 
<br>  Iâ€™m a very practical and conservative individual who is also disciplined, organized and having a high sense of duty. <br>
In addition, I'm not easily upset in stressful situations, I am more described as being resilient and calm. As an introvert I tend to observe more and speak less.
</p> <br>

<p style="font-size:110%;"> Looking at the recommended career paths, its quiet astonishing as a few of the recommeded paths were on my list and also my intended career is highlighted in the midst of it all. </p>

<p style="font-size:110%;"> The best sport ever is football  followed by volleyball. <br> I say this because I'm a football fanatic.</p>
<p style="font-size:110%;"> In my spare time I enjoy playing either of the mentioned sports. <p>

<p style="font-size:110%;"> My belief is that often times, people become the thing they fear the most.<br> In my experiences I've learmt, slowly is the fastest way to get where I want to be. <br> Finally surround myself with persoms whose eyes light up when they see me coming. <p>
