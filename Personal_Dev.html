<h1 align="center"> <i>PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT</i> </h1>
<br>
<p style="font-size:110%;"> A person should always see to develop their skills both for personal and professional purposes.</p> 
<p style="font-size:110%;">Professional development looks at areas in which new skills are gained and previous skills garnered through continuing education and career training after entering the workforce. </p>
</br>
<h3> My Strenghts</h3>

<p style="font-size:110%;"> Three of my strenghts are: 
 <ol type="I" >
       <li>  Understanding others needs. </li>
       <li>  Detail-oriented. </li>
       <li>  Assessing the needs of others.  </li>
        <ol>

</p>

<p style="font-size:110%;"> Over the past three years these strenghts have been developed even further due to circumstances that I often found myself in. </p>
<p style="font-size:110%;">  Its fulfilling to put the needs of others before my own and over time the appreciation of such action is shown by individuals in various ways. </p>
<p style="font-size:110%;"> Being detail oriented has allowed whatever I do to get even more recognition.  </p>

<br> </br>

<h3 align="center"> <b><u> <i> Reflecting on the Chapters from Twelve Pillars </b></u> </i> </h3>

<p style="font-size:110%;">
One thing thus far that I have captured from the chapter is to have a friend that means you well. One that checks in regular and give solid advices. In addition the importance of goal setting is highlighted. The moment a person has defined their career and sets their goals which they would like to achieve throughout their career and most importantly make an effort to achieve those goals then they will become pleased with the path they had chosen and not doubt themselves nor regret making such a decision. I’ve also learnt that time management is an important aspect in our daily life. 
</p>
 <br>

<p style="font-size:110%;">Spending my time on that which bring entertainment rather than that which brings me closer to the goals I have set is the biggest waste of time because at the end of the day the entertainment will cease and I would be no closer to the achieving the goals than I was the day before. I’ve also learnt the benefit of surrounding yourself with persons whose interest aligns with yours. In this way when one feels overwhelmed and is on the verge of giving up, there is always motivation coming from the group to keep pressing on. Seeing that successful people take a course of action that coincides with their belief it is important to be surrounded by that positivity, as you will learn valuable tips and even see different approaches in achieving your goals.

</p> <br>
<p style="font-size:110%;">Finally, I’ve read and understood the value of having a formal education in today’s society. Most employers are requiring a first degree from all interested applicants as a mode of formality. Beyond the formal education, the book spoke about self-education, which refers to improving one’s self along their lifetime. After the formal education, if I don’t put into practice all the knowledge that was given to me and learn from the experiences I had as well as the experiences of others and approach each situation with the right attitude then success would elude me as attitude plays a vital role in anyone becoming successful.
